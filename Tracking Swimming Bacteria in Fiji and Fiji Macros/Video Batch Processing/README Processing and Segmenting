V1 subtracts the background and descpeckles videos in a folder and replaces the videos with the new, processed ones.

V2 does what V1 does but binarizes and feathers the binarized signal.

V3 does what V2 does except that it now watersheds and analyzes the particles and replaces each particle at their centre of mass with a nanosquare, a 3x3 area of signal.

V4 does what V3 does but but without the features of V1 or V2, so no post processing. Intended use is for simulations which do not need post-processing.

V5 does what V4 does except it executes it on a folder of folders. That is you select a folder, and all of the videos within the subfolders will be processed.

“Segment.ijm” is a standalone macro exclusively used for testing.
